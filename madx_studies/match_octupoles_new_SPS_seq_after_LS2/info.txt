A) The file job003_match_octupoles_to_detuningCoefficients.py is the same that can be found in the directory ../optics_checks/

B) Sensitivity studies already perforemd:
1) Sensitvity of the octupole matching to different energies
No sensitivity to the beam energy. Same results for 26GeV, 200 GeV and 270 GeV.

2) Sensitivity of the octupole matching to the bunch length
No sensitivity to the bunch length
